### Installation
The game can be launched nearly immediately after inserting the disc. Once the game loads, player is only able to play one gamemode as Darth Vader on Hoth. During that time, the rest of the game is being installed to the hard drive. At first it can be a bit misleading since there is no information about the progress of the installation (no percentage or progression bar visible). After a while, the game will eventually install and the player will be prompted to press the option button to start the full version of the game. The installation can take a long time, depending on the PS4 model and the storage installed in it (around 30 min on my system)
___
### Gaming Experience/Functionality
The game is fully playable with three offline modes (TRAINING/BATTLES/SURVIVAL) available. The single-player/coop/versus modes all work as expected. No major game breaking bugs discovered.
___
### Summary
The game works fine completely offline and can be a lot of fun especially when playing in coop/versus mode, however players do miss out on a few more maps and modes added later in updates, as well as all the multiplayer modes, which this game primarily focuses on.
