# Insert and Play

Database created to share my results playing and testing physical games on different consoles.

# [Test Results](https://github.com/kimuraseki/IAP/blob/main/RESULTS.md)

## Why did I create the database?
I strongly believe in video game preservation and I think that people today and also in the future should be able to enjoy the games that were created even decades ago. All games are worth preserving and have an important place in the history.

Did you know that a vast majority of physical video games are actually fully printed on the discs?
You can play them without ever connecting to the internet!

Truly __Insert and Play__ (hence the name :D)

Try it for yourself (for example on a PlayStation 4/5 console):
1. Turn off the internet connection in the console settings
2. Insert a game disc you haven't installed in the system yet
3. Wait for it to install the game data from the disc to your console __*(Remember: Installing â‰  Downloading!)*__
4. Press play and enjoy the game!

## Why should you care?
Please, read the explanation over at [DoesItPlay](https://www.doesitplay.org/about), they did it much better than I could.

Anyways, think about:
- internet outages, unavailable servers, expired licenses, delistings, closed storefronts, account being banned/hacked

- What if you wanted to play a game from your childhood but since it was __online only and the servers were shutdown__ years ago, or the game was __delisted/removed from your account__?
- What if you wanted to share your love for games with your children, family or friends, show them what you used to play, __what experience made you love video games__?
- It's also about the __global availability__ of these games for the general public. If the game only existed digitally, fully controlled by the publisher, there would be no legal way to obtain the game to enjoy and preserve.

__My Personal Experience:__

It's always a special moment when you get you first game for a particular console. I certainly still remember mine!
My first game for the PS4 was The Crew. I really enjoyed it and still remember my first hours playing it. Well, memories are now all that's left for me, because on April 1st 2024, The Crew servers were permanently [shutdown](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-crew/the-crew/news-updates/mOR3tviszkxfeQCUKxhOV/an-update-on-the-crew), making the game unplayable for me and everyone else who would like to experience it for themselves.

## What can you do?
- __Buy the majority of your games physicaly__, ideally after consulting my database (still WIP!) or even better, visiting [DoesItPlay](https://www.doesitplay.org/). They have a much bigger list of video games from many platforms and were the main motivation for me to create my own database.
- __Spread awarness__
- __Tell the publishers__ why you care, "vote with your wallet"
- If you're on PC, __consider buying digital games that are DRM-Free__ and grant you full ownership over the purchased copy. See [DRM-free stores](https://github.com/kimuraseki/IAP?tab=readme-ov-file#digital-drm-free-stores)
